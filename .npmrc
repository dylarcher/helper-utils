# This file configures settings for the npm (Node Package Manager) client.
# These settings apply to all npm commands run within this project.

# Enables or disables running `npm audit` after `npm install`.
# `audit = true` means `npm audit` will run automatically, checking for vulnerabilities.
audit = true
# Sets the minimum severity level for `npm audit` to report.
# `moderate` means `npm audit` will report vulnerabilities of moderate, high, or critical severity.
# Other levels include: low, high, critical.

# Specifies the version of the lockfile format to be used.
# `lockfile-version = 3` is the format used by npm v7 and later, which includes
# improvements for determinism and reproducibility of builds.
lockfile-version = 3
# Determines whether a `package-lock.json` (or `npm-shrinkwrap.json`) file is created and updated.
# `package-lock = true` ensures that a lockfile is used, which is crucial for
# consistent dependency resolution across different environments and installations.

# Specifies the default npm registry to use for fetching and publishing packages.
# `https://registry.npmjs.org/` is the official public npm registry.
registry = https://registry.npmjs.org/
# Configures npm to save exact versions of dependencies in `package.json` (e.g., "1.2.3" instead of "^1.2.3").
# `save-exact = true` helps ensure that `npm install` always installs the same dependency versions,
# further enhancing build reproducibility, especially when a lockfile is also used.
save-exact = true
# Enforces strict SSL certificate validation for all HTTPS requests made by npm.
# `strict-ssl = true` is the default and recommended setting for security, ensuring
# that npm communicates with registries over a secure, verified connection.
