// Attempt to import from the barrel file.
// Adjust path if utils.js is actually in src/ and not src/utils/
// Assuming utils.js is in the same directory as this spec file for now.
// Based on previous task, utils.js was created in src/ not src/utils.
// So the import path should be '../utils.js' if this spec is in src/utils/
// Or, if utils.js is in src/utils/ then './utils.js' is correct.

// Let's assume the task meant for utils.js to be in src/ (as created previously)
// and this utils.spec.js is also being created in src/ to match.
// If utils.spec.js is intended to be in src/utils/, the import path needs to be '../utils.js'.
// The prompt says "For src/utils.js: Create a new test file src/utils.spec.js".
// This implies utils.js is in src/ and utils.spec.js should be in src/ as well.
// Or that utils.js is in src/utils/ and utils.spec.js is in src/utils/.
// Given that `src/utils.js` was created in `src/` in a previous step, this spec file should also be in `src/`.
