# This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
# It's used to prevent committing generated files, temporary files, or user-specific
# editor/OS files to the repository.

# Editor directories and files
# These patterns ignore configuration and workspace files generated by common IDEs.
# Keeping these out of the repository ensures that personal editor settings
# do not conflict with others' or clutter the project history.

# OS generated files
# These are system files automatically created by various operating systems.
# They are specific to a user's environment and not relevant to the project itself.

# Logs
# Log files are typically generated during development or runtime for debugging.
# They can grow large and change frequently, so they are usually ignored.

# Dependency directories
# This directory contains all the project's dependencies installed by package managers
# like npm, yarn, or pnpm. These are not versioned because they can be reinstalled
# from package manifest files (e.g., package.json, package-lock.json).
node_modules/

# Coverage directories
# Directories used by testing frameworks to store code coverage reports.
# These are generated artifacts and should not be committed.
docs/tests/.temp/

# Temporary files
# A general pattern to ignore various temporary files that might be created
# by editors or other tools (e.g., backup files ending with a tilde).
